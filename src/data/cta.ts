    "I’ve been in the same boat, scrolling and second-guessing, and I know how draining it is. After talking with the software community, I learned it’s not just developers.

RoleRadar checks company job listings for you, surfaces the roles that fit, and takes some stress off the daily search. We should spend our time on meaningful things. Let tech handle the boring, repetitive parts. Thanks for trying it and sharing feedback 🚀",
